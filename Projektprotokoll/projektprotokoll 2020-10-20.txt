Jamal: Added some tests.
Jonathan: Added levelcount and text to see relevant info in Frogger. Added function comments for model (Frogger)
Oliver: Added function comments to controller and view (SpaceInvaders). Went through Snake code and gave Jamal feedback on exaclty what needs to be refactored in snake model
in order to get rid of JavaFX dependencies and bad MVC-structure (model had view functionality).

## Discussion items (35 min)
Follow up on refactoring common code and alike.
Go through all documents (RAD, SDD, Design model, Domain model) to see what needs to be done.

Snake needs to be refactored almost completely to remove JavaFX dependencies. Jonathan gave Jamal a rough outline of classes needed to make a basic snake game and
some rough estimations of what functions and their implementation would be.

## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)

All members should work on all documents (RAD, SDD, Design model, Domain model) and final report before next supervisor meeting and hand-in.

Jamal has to remove all JavaFX dependencies from snakemodel and refactor according to MVC-pattern.
