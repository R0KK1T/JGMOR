Date: 2020-10-19
Chair: Oliver Ljung
Participants: Jonathan Stigson, Mhd Jamal Basal, Robert Sahlqvist, Oliver Ljung, Georges Kayembe


## Objectives (5 min) 
Review the entire repository and go through comments and response from Johannes Mattsson recieved via Slack.

## Reports (15 min) from previous meeting
Georges: refactored so that his view and controller now fits ViewNavigator. Added collision and tests.
Jamal: Added SnakeGame as a menu rather than a game to ViewNavigator. Game crashes when trying to start Snake because snakemodel depends on javafx from java 8. Added tests.
Jonathan: Added interface, IRepresentable and IPositionable to help with visual representation. Added enum ObstacleType to replace need for inheritance.
          Added ability to pause Frogger and added textures.
Oliver: Added winning and losing to Space Invaders, added function comments to entire spaceInvadersModel.
Robert: Added groundwork for displaying score in Pong. Added comments to the model of Pong.

## Discussion items (35 min)

Went through comments from Johannes regarding ViewNavigator and Application.
Went thorugh each member's code looking for irregularities.


## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)

Jonathan and Oliver figured out how to removed circular dependencies in ViewNavigator and MainApplication,
and also split ViewNavigator into ViewNavigator and MainView.
Removed redundant JavaFX dependencies from FXMLControllers.
Refactored common code (package common in model) to avoid/remove code duplication across games.

Jamal has to remove all JavaFX dependencies from snakemodel and refactor according to MVC-pattern.
Georges will look over his code to see if a change from (inheritance) isA- to hasA-dependency is possible.
