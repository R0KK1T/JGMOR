## Discussion items (35 min)
Update RAD and SDD for completion purposes
Worked on ViewNavigator which connects the MainApplication controllers.
Only Pong, Frogger and Space Invaders were implemented into the ViewNavigator as the other 2 games (Snake and Breakout) was not compatible because of different impementation of controller and view.


## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
All individual games should be finished by 2020-10-19 (before next meeting).
Georges and Mhd Jamal need to refactor their controllers to fit the rest of the group's, otherwise their games can't be implemented into the ViewNavigator.
